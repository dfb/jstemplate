# jstemplate - designer-friendly Javascript templates

## Overview

jstemplate is a simple library for client-side templates that leave the original HTML structure
intact so that you don't have to put the templates in script tags, you don't have to dice up the
HMTL into little chunks, etc. The upshot is that the templates are far more maintainable,
especially if you have a non-programmer designer who is creating the HTML.

The library includes a templating engine for knockout.js.
